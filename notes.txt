Their Moms' birthdays are both on the 18th (but different months).  Their Dads' birthdays are both on the 2nd (but different months).
Kate's family used to have a dog named Shadow.  Now they call Chad, Chadow.  Chad's family has a dog named Molly.  Kate's sister's name is also Molly.  
Kate and Chad both went to IU.  They both lived in the same dorm freshman year.  All of their friends were friends but they never met until Senior year.  
Chad asked Kate to be his girlfriend while rowing a canoe in Indiana.  They also got engaged on a boat - but it was bigger than a canoe - and in Malaysia. 
Chad found the ring in Thailand.  He had help from an African Gem trader named Sisqo (no joke!).  
Kate and Chad lived 8 hours apart after college (St. Paul / Chicago).  Then they lived 28 hours apart (Aspen / Chicago).  Now they're never apart (in Korea).  
Kate used to be a vegetarian.  Chad didn't like vegetables when he was little.  He'd spit out the Gerber peas as a baby.
Kate likes to run.  Chad likes to ride bikes.  They both like swim.
