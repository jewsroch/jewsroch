Our favorite places to eat:
Leland
The Bluebird Bar and Restaurant
In the bar they have great pizza and peppermint ice cream
In the main restaurant my favorite is the whitefish--blackened.  Every meal is served with cinnamon rolls and a northern michigan favorite, peas and peanuts.
Also try the “Early” Bird for breakfast!
